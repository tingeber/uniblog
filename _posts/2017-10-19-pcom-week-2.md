Here's a couple of videos on my progress with Arduino tinkering.

# Project 2 - Spaceship

This project was about programming the microcontroller to react to physical (digital) input, i.e. my fingers pushing a button.

# Project 3 - Heat Sensor

First time playing with analogue sensors - it was fun to figure out how to actually activate a sensor with no easy heat source around me. Lighters? Dumb idea. Good thing my lamp doesn't have an LED bulb...

# Project 4 - RGB Sensor

Analogue input again, and playing with the big RGB LED from the kit. The red/green/blue gels are pretty flimsy, while the gel holders are massive, so together they make an odd couple. But not in a family-comedy sort of way, more like "how did anyone think this will work" kind of way. I resorted to veeeeery carefully balancing the gels on top of the light sensors. It worked.

# Project 5 - Servo Motor

So this is where my Mac and my Arduino decided they never met before, and will not talk to strangers. I spent the better part of my evening troubleshooting the complete lack of meaningful port options on the Arduino app — besides the _ever so useful Bluetooth Input_ — but I came up short. But the code compiles, and the capacitors didn't explode, so we should be all set. For now, here's a picture of the constructed board:
