Hello world.

This is where I'll be documenting my research. This is probably also where I'll be documenting the rest of my academic endeavours. If in the meantime you want to read some of my work from before, check out my 2017 thesis on [algorithms as gatekeepers](https://www.gitbook.com/book/tingeber/the-new-gatekeepers/details), my post on [male privilege and networks](https://medium.com/@tingeber/on-male-privilege-and-networks-437a1ad1e51e), or just hop over to my main site, [tin.fyi](https://tin.fyi).

Looking forward to filling this space up with proper new content. Like for example an assignment in short sci-fi story form.
